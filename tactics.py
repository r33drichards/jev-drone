"""Jev tactical layer: the drone's programmable common sense.

Everything a human should review lives at the top of this file: the questions,
the option rubrics, and the thresholds. Nothing else in the project hard-codes a
number that changes how the aircraft reacts to a judgment.

Runs off the control loop in a worker thread. The flight code never blocks on it
and never *needs* it -- it reads whatever judgment is currently cached, and the
reflex layer in run.py owns safety regardless of what comes back.

Two backends answer the same questions: Jev over the TypeSafe API (JSON only), or
Laya Vision (https://github.com/r33drichards/laya-vision) run locally, which can
also see the onboard camera frame.
